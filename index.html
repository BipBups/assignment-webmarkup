                    <p>While wearable tech is nothing new in the fitness and athletics world, advancements in sensor
                        technology and accuracy have wholly revolutionized the fitness tracker industry, making wearable
                        tech one of the biggest technology advancements in sports.</p>
                    <p>As recently as a decade ago, athletes and fitness enthusiasts interested in tracking basic
                        workout metrics had to rely on clunky devices that were ugly and impractical. <em>Today,
                            wearable
                            tech is so well-designed and functional that it's transcended into the world of
                            fashion.</em></p>
                    <p>High-end wearable tech products allow athletes and fitness enthusiasts to accurately measure
                        metrics such as steps taken, stairs climbed, calories burned, and so much more. These devices
                        can even track your sleep and provide meaningful data on how you can improve your routine.</p>

                    <p>Debuting at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, VAR has wholly changed the soccer world, and it's been
                        adopted by other leagues, including UEFA and the Premier League as well.</p>
                    <p>VAR, which is short for video assistant referee, leverages emerging camera technologies in sports
                        to make refereeing more precise. With VAR, a team of referees located in the control room
                        analyzes and corrects every missed call or non-call in the game, along with goals, penalty
                        calls, and cases of mistaken identity.</p>
                    <p>Any soccer fan can tell you, the referees on the field are far from perfect. While the human
                        element of refereeing is a necessary and exciting part of sports, as fans, we want to see the
                        best team (or athlete) win. VAR helps ensure that referees make the correct calls every time, so
                        the game is fair and equitable.</p>

                    <p>Arguably the greatest of all sport technology advancements has been the development of devices
                        that can measure different metrics during a game or race. Today, there are sport-specific sensor
                        devices for virtually every athletic activity under the sun.</p>
                    <p>The Easton Power Sensor is one excellent example. This device slips onto the end of a bat and
                        tracks metrics such as swing speed, power, directionality, and more. The Zepp 2 Golf Sensor is
                        another impressive example of sports technology, and it provides 3D modeling of your golf
                        swing.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these examples, there are plenty of other sport-specific sensors that are revolutionizing
                        how athletes look at their game.</p>
